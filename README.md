#Linux Sysadmin Practice

This repo tracks my learning and practical exercises to build Linux system administration skills. The goals is to practice user manangement, services, security hardening, networking and scripting.

## Day 1 (14 July 2025)

- Added the user to the 'sudo' with 'usermod -aG'
- Saved terminal commands to 'adduser-commands.txt'
- Pushed to Github

## Day 2 (15 July 2025)
- Manage service using 'systemctl'
- Checked, stopped, started, disabled, enabled, cron service
- Saved terminal command history to 'service-management.txt'

## Day 3 (16 July 2025)

- Practiced file permission and ownership using 'chmod' and 'chown'
- Created a test file, changed ownership to 'testuser'
- Restricted file access to owner only with 'chmod 600'
